        <p>The <em>Blue-Footed Boobie Bird</em> is easily identified due to its bright blue feet. 
        These birds live in flocks on the coast of Central and South America. 
        Nearly half the global population of Blue-Footed Boobies lives on the Galapagos Islands. 
        They have adapted to use their long bodies to dive nearly 80 feet into the sea for shellfish, 
        which comprises most of their diet. <strong>The name "Booby" probably comes from the Spanish 
        word "bobo" meaning stupid, which may be how early European colonists may have seen these clumsy birds. </strong></p>
